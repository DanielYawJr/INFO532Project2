The Locator bar displays a URL, which is short for Uniform Resource Locator.  Every page on every site in the Internet has a unique URL just like every person has a unique palm print.<p>
Here's a sample URL: <b>http://home.mcom.com/home/home.html</b><p>
Netscape gives you the opportunity to type a URL directly into the
<b>Location:</b> text field.  Using the URL, Netscape will bring you the
specified page just as if you had clicked on an automatic link.  This
way, if you have somehow heard or read about an URL that you want to
check out, you can use the Locator to get there instantly. <p>  
When you enter URLs into the field, make sure you include the 3 things
Netscape needs to know to go get the page you want: <b>the protocol</b>,
the <b>server</b>, and the <b>path</b>.<p> 

Protocols are the <b>"http:"</b> part (which can also be <b>ftp:</b> or <b>gopher:</b>).<br>
<br>
The server is the name of the machine the file is on, preceded by two slashes - <b>"//home.mcom.com"</b>.<br>
<br>
The path includes the list of directories plus the filename of the page which dwells within them - the one that you want to see.  These are separated by forward slashes a la <b>"/home/home/home.html"</b>.
