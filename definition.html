    Mosaic Communications will use a five level problem severity 
    assignment to define and prioritize customer trouble reports.  The response time (RT) to 
    work around or fix the problem is indicated (in working days) next to each level.
    These levels are as follows:
    <p>
    <b>Level One (RT: 30 minutes to 2 days)</b>
    <ul>
    Indicates a critical condition where the server,  
    the network, or mission critical service or application is down 
    due to Mosaic Communications product and requires an immediate solution.  
    </ul><p>
    <b>Level Two (RT: 5 days)</b>
    <ul>
    Indicates that the server or the network is operational 
    but the Customer's business is impacted.  This relates to a 
    non-functioning service or application that depends on Mosaic 
    Communications' product and is critical to the operation of the Customer's business.
    </ul><p>
    <b>Level Three (RT: 10 days)</b><p>
    <ul>
    Indicates that the server or the network is operational but some 
    functions have limited capability.  Overall business operations are 
    not adversely impacted.  Pertains to HTTP server access, GUI presentation, 
    or any non-mission critical incident.
    </ul><p>
    <b>Level Four (RT: 60 days on a business justifiable basis)</b>
    <ul>
    Indicates that the Customer and Mosaic Communications have diagnosed the 
    problem and have implemented a suitable work around.  However,  the problem 
    still needs to be evaluated to determine a permanent fix.
    </ul>
    <b>Level Five (RT: as evaluated)</b><p>
    <ul>
    Assigned to questions, comments, enhancement requests, or other Customer 
    communication which comes into Mosaic Communications' support organization and 
    needs to be tracked to ensure that Mosaic concentrates on its responsibility to customer satisfaction.</ul>
