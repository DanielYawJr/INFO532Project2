If you are using an SGI machine, you can save the following file and
use it as a starting point for your mailcap file. Be sure to set the
location of your mailcap file in your Preferences window.

# Example .mailcap file for SGI machines
#
# First a note about syntax:
#    The first token in a configuration line represents a mime type.
#    A mime type is of the form "SubGroup/Item" and either token
#    can be replaced by the wildcard character "*"
# 
#    the second token is the command that you would run
#    when the specified mime type is encountered.  An example
#    would be "xv %s" where %s will be replaced by a filename
#
#    remaining tokens represent name value pairs.
#
#    the "test=<some test command>" pair invokes the test command
#    specified and checks the UNIX shell return code to see if the
#    test passed.  If the test passes the mime mapping is made, otherwise
#    the mapping is not made.
#
#    the "stream-buffer-size=<number>" pair tells the application
#    to use a popen command to invoke the program specified and to
#    pipe all data into the command.  Only programs that can handle
#    piped input can use this method.  When this method is used
#    a "%s" should not be included in the command.  You should
#    make sure that the program you wish to use can accept piped
#    data by trying something like this before using it:
#       cat "YOUR_DATA_FILE_HERE" | COMMAND_TO_TEST
#
#    You may continue lines by using the backslash character "\"

# plays AIFF files
audio/x-aiff; sfplay %s

# plays AIFC files
audio/x-aifc; sfplay %s

# use this preferentially to do streaming audio if you have 
# the playulaw program
#audio/basic; playulaw; stream-buffer-size=2000

# otherwise, if you don't have playulaw, use this
audio/basic; sfplay %s

# use this to play MPEG audio if you have maplay installed  
#audio/x-mpeg; maplay -; stream-buffer-size=2000

# use this to play MPEG video files if you have mpeg_play installed
#video/mpeg; mpeg_play %s

# here is an interesting command that enables you to sit
# in front of a different UNIX machine than the one where 
# you are running Netscape and still here audio.
#
#audio/basic; rsh YOUR_HOST_HERE /usr/local/bin/playulaw; \
#	test=test `hostname`x != YOUR_HOST_HEREx; stream-buffer-size=2000

# use this to display postscript files
#application/postscript; xpsview %s

# this is the default for non GIF or JPEG images
image/*; xv %s

# if you would prefer an external viewer for GIF and JPEG images
# uncomment the following lines for XV to act as your external viewer.
#image/gif; xv %s
#image/jpg; xv %s
