Hey, Ma. I got a new job. I'm no longer the night manager at Lothario's
House
of Horrors in the Tenderloin. I'm writing a book about the Internet.
<p>
Good for you, Tooey. Isn't that the same organization James Bond works
for?
<p>
Close, Ma, but no. This is information highway stuff, not a spy
thriller. This
is a manual for a software program called Netscape so when you turn on
your
computer something more intelligent happens than flying toasters.
<p>
But last visit you were so proud to show us your flying toasters.
<p>
I know, Ma, but we've all got to grow. Netscape is real. It brings
information
from computers around the world to your screen.
<p>
That's nice.
<p>
I mean it, Ma.
<p>
Dad and I like the aquarium fish more than the toasters with wings.<p>
<p>
Ma, those are screen savers. Netscape brings real information.<p>
<p>
Yes, Tooey, I'm sure it does. Why don't you tell your father about
it?
<p>

Hello, son. Mom told me you're working for the government.
<p>
No, not the government, Dad. The Internet got its start in the
government; now
it's a term used to describe a collection of computers worldwide that
are
connected in one way or another. It's a network. No one owns the whole
thing.
It's more a collaboration among all kinds of organizations and people
to split
the cost and responsibilities of sharing information.
<p>
That reminds me, son. I read the book you gave me by that Toole guy, A
Confederacy of Dunces. Quite a hoot.
<p>
So I think you and Mom ought to try using Netscape. I can get you
connected to
the Internet on your computer at home. Then you can browse around to
see what
interests you.
<p>
Don't have much time for the computer these days. Am volunteering at
the
hospital two days a week and the library one day week. Help out at the
USO
Wednesday evenings. Play golf. Keep the house up. Take your mother out
to
dinner. When I need to write something down, I find it easier to pick
up a
pen.
<p>
Just try it, Dad. This isn't a crummy word processor that gives you
empty pages
and a thick manual. With Netscape, your pages are filled with information
on
topics you choose. Pages with color pictures and nice text and maybe
sounds or
movies.
<p>
Yes, I know. Computers are the future. Show your mother how it works.
She's
better than I am. She can make the toasters swim with the colored
fish.

Here, Ma. I set everything up for you. You're looking at the Netscape
home page.
To go somewhere, just point the mouse over any colored text and click.
You can always
come back to where you were by clicking on the <b> Back </b> button in
this toolbar or selecting <b>Back</b> from the <b>Go</b> menu. See
these words
<a href="../online-manual.html">Netscape Handbook</a>? That's the book I'm working
on. Try clicking on it. Go on.
Just
point and click. That's right. Now see the colors spinning on this
Netscape logo.
That means the page you clicked on is being transferred from a remote
computer
to your computer. Same thing with this status bar and these messages in
the
status area. They are all feedback to tell you how information you
requested is
coming from a server computer through an Internet connection to your
computer.
<p>
So I'm on the information highway. This is fun. How come your book is
only one
page long?
<p>
There's more, Ma. You're just looking at the title and the table of
contents.
Netscape brings you one page at a time. I could have put the whole book
in one
long scrolling page but it's more efficient to transport documents in
smaller
chunks. Maybe some people want to read only the fun, folksy part. 
This way they can click on <a href="intro.html#RTFToC0">heartwarming introduction</a> to
receive just the section they want rather than the whole book.
<p>
I can't wait to read it, but I need to get my glasses. Sometimes I get
a
headache trying to read on the screen. You wouldn't have a printed
copy, would
you?
<p>
Yeah, I've got a printed copy. I don't like reading long documents on
screen
either. I just want to show you how you can click on certain words that
are
linked automatically to a new page. Click on any of the highlighted
words in
the table of contents and you'll see the page that is linked. Netscape
works like
a television remote control except instead of channels you select
pages. It's
an automatic, random access page-turner.

Hi Tooey. Ma says you took her for a ride on the information
highway.
<p>
Yeah, but she wasn't wearing her glasses so she didn't see anything. I
showed
her Netscape. It's pretty simple: you run the program while connected to
the
Internet and you look at pages, some with pictures and art as colorful
as any
magazine. Often, what you see on one page is capable of bringing
related
information that's on another page. You just click on colored words or
pictures
and, zoom, another page, linked to the one you're seeing, comes flying
into
your computer from the Internet. These linked pages are distributed on
server
computers all over the world and Netscape is the software that brings
them to
you.
<p>
Who makes the pages and, if they're on servers all over the world, 
who makes the links between the pages?
<p>
That's exactly what everyone is trying to figure out. Right now, pages
are made
by a bunch of Internet geeks who know how to get information inside
these
server computers. But that's about to change. More and more, pages and
their
links are going to be personalized so that every individual can find
and keep
handy the information they want. So the first step is retrieving good
information. The next step is publishing information for others.
